# Package delivery with a group of agents

This is the repository for the following problem:

Given n drones of different speeds, 1 package and 1 destination, find a way for the drones to deliver the package to the destination as fast as possible.

Two drones can exchange a package. Drones can have different speed or different range (future implementation).
